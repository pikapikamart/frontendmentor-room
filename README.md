## My process

This second challenge was pretty fun since I don't almost build accordion likes object and I made just using css with no js, but other part with js. This part of my everyday 1 frontend mentor project, but, I will be pausing for now since freelance work is calling me. But I will resume and continue making 1 everyday project. (This is the refactored version. This is more accessible compared to the former version) .

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Javascript 
- Sass preprocessor

I said that I won't use any frameworks and build it from scratch to be more exciting and challenging

### What I learned

I learned that by creating this website, this challenge, I saw that I can easily accomplish projects if I put focus on it, and really put my effort doing it

### Continued development

I want to focus more on creating more complex designs and also designing things on my own time
